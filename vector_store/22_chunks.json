    "text": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving field of technology that enables machines to simulate human intelligence, such as learning from data, recognizing patterns, understanding language, and making decisions. It powers many everyday tools we use, from search engines and recommendation systems to voice assistants, medical diagnostics, and autonomous vehicles. By combining large amounts of data with advanced algorithms, AI helps organizations improve efficiency, solve complex problems, and create smarter, more personalized experiences. As AI continues to advance, it offers enormous potential to transform industries, while also raising important questions about ethics, privacy, and responsible use.",
